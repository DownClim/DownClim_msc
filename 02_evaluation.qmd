# Evaluations {.unnumbered}

We computed for every projection evaluations metrics against observed before and after downscaling against observations in the evaluation period. Evaluation metrics include Pearson's correlation coefficient (CC), root mean square error (RMSE), standard deviation of errors (SDE), and mean bias (bias).
